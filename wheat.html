    <p>Wheat, any of several species of cereal grasses of the genus Triticum (family Poaceae) and their edible grains. Wheat is one of the oldest and most important of the cereal crops. Of the thousands of varieties known, the most important are common wheat (Triticum aestivum), used to make bread; durum wheat (T. durum), used in making pasta (alimentary pastes) such as spaghetti and macaroni; and club wheat (T. compactum), a softer type, used for cake, crackers, cookies, pastries, and flours. Additionally, some wheat is used by industry for the production of starch, paste, malt, dextrose, gluten, alcohol, and other products.

        Flowers on a wheat plant.
        The wheat plant has long slender leaves and stems that are hollow in most varieties. The inflorescences are composed of varying numbers of minute flowers, ranging from 20 to 100. The flowers are borne in groups of two to six in structures known as spikelets, which later serve to house the subsequent two or three grains produced by the flowers. Though grown under a wide range of climates and soils, wheat is best adapted to temperate regions with rainfall between 30 and 90 cm (12 and 36 inches). Winter and spring wheat are the two major types of the crop, with the severity of the winter determining whether a winter or spring type is cultivated. Winter wheat is always sown in the fall; spring wheat is generally sown in the spring but can be sown in the fall where winters are mild.
        
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
        wheat
        wheat
        Heads of wheat and unprocessed wheat grains (Triticum species).
        The nutritional composition of the wheat grain varies somewhat with differences in climate and soil. On an average, the kernel contains 12 percent water, 70 percent carbohydrates, 12 percent protein, 2 percent fat, 1.8 percent minerals, and 2.2 percent crude fibres. Thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and small amounts of vitamin A are present, but the milling processes removes most of those nutrients with the bran and germ.
      
        Most wheat used for food requires processing. The grain is cleaned and then conditioned by the addition of water so that the kernel breaks up properly. In milling, the grain is cracked and then passed through a series of rollers. As the smaller particles are sifted out, the coarser particles pass to other rollers for further reduction. About 72 percent of the milled grain is recovered as white flour. Flour made from the whole kernel is called graham flour and becomes rancid with prolonged storage because of the germ-oil content retained. White flour, which does not contain the germ, preserves longer. Inferior and surplus wheats and various milling by-products are used for livestock feeds.
        
        The greatest portion of the wheat flour produced is used for breadmaking. Wheats grown in dry climates are generally hard types, having protein content of 11–15 percent and strong gluten (elastic protein). The hard type produces flour best suited for breadmaking. The wheats of humid areas are softer, with protein content of about 8–10 percent and weak gluten. The softer type of wheat produces flour suitable for cakes, crackers, cookies, and pastries and household flours. Durum wheat semolina (from the endosperm) is used for making pastas, or alimentary pastes.</p>
 

<h3>How To Grow Wheat Efficiently On A Large Farm</h3>

<p>If you are wondering how to grow wheat, it’s necessary to first clarify that there are two main crop varieties: winter and spring. Although each has its own unique growing requirements and cultivation specifics, growing spring and winter wheat has more similarities than differences.</p>
<p>Good care for both species entails watering at the proper times during distinct growth stages, adding NPK fertilizers, and keeping a vigilant eye out for weeds, pests, and diseases. These and other wheat growing tasks can benefit from the use of precision farming technologies. Once the crop has reached maturity, modern agricultural machinery again comes in handy, allowing for quick harvesting and preparing the grain for storage.</p>
  <h3>Soil And Nutrients</h3>
  <p>Knowing in which soil wheat is grown is essential for maximizing crop yields. Deep, fertile loamy soil with good drainage and air circulation is ideal for growing any variety. On the contrary, peat types of soil, which are heavy in iron, sodium, and magnesium, prove highly unfavorable for growing this grain.</p>
  <p>Optimal wheat growing pH is between 5.5 and 7.5 (slightly acidic and neutral soils). Low soil fertility and high salinity are detrimental soil conditions for growing wheat. Irrigated fields are more likely to have salinity issues. Plantlet viability, primary and secondary tiller production, leaf and spikelet production, and water availability can all be negatively impacted by soil salinization.</p>
<h3>How To Plant Wheat</h3>
<p>The first step is determining the optimal time for sowing wheat, which varies from type to type. If you want to avoid the negative effects of frost on your growing crop, you should choose a planting time for winter wheat in the late summer/early fall, roughly six to eight weeks before the first frost. The first spring months, when the soil is still chilly, are best suited for planting spring wheat. Common procedures for planting wheat include:</p>
<ul>
      <li>Tillage. First and foremost, prepare a field before growing wheat. The recommended depth of soil tilling is 6 inches (15 cm). When you’re done, the ground should be at maximum evenness.</li>
    <li>Spreading compost (if needed). Light brown, overly dry, or slightly rough soil may benefit from being covered with compost. This adds nutrients to the soil, which may improve how the plants grow.</li>
     <li>Broadcasting seeds. This method of sowing wheat entails scattering the seed into the prepared soil, spacing it at a width of about 3 inches (7 cm). If you prefer intercropping or companion planting, increase the spacing between rows of wheat to 8 inches (20cm). The optimal wheat seed planting depth is about 0.5 inches (1 cm)</li>
    <li>Putting a thin soil layer over the seeds. This shields the seed from exposure to the sun and keeps birds from eating it before it can germinate. A 1.5-inch (4-cm) layer is ideal for the spring crop, while a 2.5-inch (6.5-cm) layer is recommended for the winter crop. Never cover the seeds with over 3 inches (7.5 cm) of soil.</li>
    <li>Watering. Water the plants as soon as possible after planting, and be sure to keep the newly planted area consistently moist until the plant sprouts and grows stronger.</li>   
</ul>

<h3>Fertilizing</h3>  <img style="float: right; margin: right 10px; margin-bottom: 5px; border:  white; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;" src="htmlpratice111111/k.jpeg" >

<p>NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) is a necesary fertilizer for growing wheat. Current high-yield varieties are more efficient at extracting nitrogen (N) from the soil, which makes them richer in protein 
    . Keep in mind, that grain yield is inversely proportional to grain protein content. That’s why it’s crucial that farmers strike the ideal balance between protein composition and yield when planning their nitrogen fertilization schedules and dosages.</p>
    
<p>Fertilizer applications that are tailored to specific field conditions yield the best outcomes. Using remote sensing technologies, and in particular the EOSDA Crop Monitoring platform, makes fertilizer management in the field a lot simpler and more efficient.</p>
<p>Farmers can employ the variable rate application (VRA) method to add the optimal amount of nitrogen fertilizer to their growing wheat, preventing nitrogen overload and the resulting low yields. Taking the vegetation map as a guide, you may split your field into zones, determine how much nitrogen fertilizer each zone needs, and figure out how much money you’ll save in the process. By using variable rate technology (VRT) to fertilize your growing crops based on site-specific needs, you may reduce the amount of money and fertilizer that is wasted as runoff.</p>
